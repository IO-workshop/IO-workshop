excerpt: "I am a PhD student from the Department of Government at the University of Essex (UK). I am interested in the construction, enforcement and effects of state-based and international institutions that regulate multinational firms.

In my PhD thesis I focus on the multilateral cooperation to regulate corporate foreign bribery. I seek to explain variations in state capacity to hold corporations accountable for exporting corruption abroad. I approach my study employing quantitative methods, and bringing together insights from the literature on international institutions and on political-economic determinants of firms' behaviors."
