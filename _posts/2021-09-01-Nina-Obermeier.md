excerpt: "I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Cornell University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations. It examines how attitudes towards international affairs shape and are shaped by processes of political contestation at the domestic level. In my dissertation project, I explore how populist radical right parties can unintentionally drive support for international economic integration among Western European publics when they engage in extremist rhetoric. I use a wide range of methods in my research, including machine learning, quantitative text analysis, survey experiments, elite interviews, and quasi-experimental research designs."
