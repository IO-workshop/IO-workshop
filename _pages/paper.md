**Call for Papers (2022):**

The Junior IO Scholars Workshop is a virtual, interdisciplinary, graduate-student-run workshop where graduate students, pre- and post-docs, and junior faculty can present and solicit feedback on their work. This workshop will be an opportunity to receive substantive feedback from peers and leaders in the field, and to develop a community of scholars with shared research interests.

We are seeking submissions from people interested in presenting their work or discussing others’ works this fall, as well as non-presenting participants at any stage in their careers. We welcome longer-form practice job talk presentations (~45 minutes) as well as shorter presentations of works in progress (~20 minutes). Presentations will be followed by time for Q&A. Participants are expected to read the papers before the workshop. The tentative dates for the fall semester presentations are 9/6, 9/20, 10/4, 10/18, 11/1, 11/15, 11/29, and 12/13 at 4:00pm Eastern.

We encourage submissions from people working on work related to international organizations, broadly defined, inclusive of international law, foreign policy, and related areas. We also welcome different types of research, including theoretical, interdisciplinary, empirical, and policy oriented works, as well as pre-analysis plans and research designs.

**Title:** ["*Foreign Mining, Labor Welfare and Local Trust: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan Gold Mine*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
There has been controversy over the impact of foreign natural resource investment on worker welfare and host country politics. This paper explores this question by analyzing Kyrgyzstan’s dominant foreign invested gold mine, which accounted for 12.5% of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP in 2020. A key finding is that the economic growth from foreign invested mine undermines the trust of the beneficiary mining industry in local communities. Using geolocated data from household panel surveys in Kyrgyzstan from 2010 to 2016, the study shows Kumtor, this largest foreign mine, offers mining workers better incomes and social benefits. However, Kumtor mining investment creates greater inequality and social division. This study also finds that the emergence of Kumtor is associated to economic grievances of the non-mining sector. Higher corporate earnings or gold prices were associated with lower trust in local leaders by mining workers, but higher trust by manufacturing workers. -->
